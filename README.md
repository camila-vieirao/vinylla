 # 🎧 **Vinylla — Spin Stories, Trade Vibes**

**Social network + marketplace for music lovers and vinyl collectors**

---

## 📀 About the Project

**Vinylla** is an MVP developed for the course **Creative Experience: Collaborative Innovation**, part of the **Computer Science program at PUCPR**, by:

* **Camila Vieira de Oliveira**
* **Luiz Henrique Matoso**
* **Guilherme Tuchanski Rocha**

The idea comes from a real gap in the market: today, there’s **no dedicated platform that truly combines musical experiences with vinyl record trading** in one ecosystem.

Vinylla brings together a **social network** and a **vinyl marketplace**, creating a space where music enthusiasts can share reviews, connect with others, and give new life to stories engraved on records.
